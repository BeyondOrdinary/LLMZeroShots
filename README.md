# LLMZeroShots
Rules are simple:
(1) Must use a publicly available LLM
(2) Must use one, and only one, prompt to generate all of the code
(3) Can not give code hints or guidance. You must simulate a user that knows nothing about software.
(4) Entire source code generation must be included here along with the prompt, model, and date of generation.
